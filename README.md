# SecureFlag Code Recipes Repository

Welcome to the SecureFlag code recipes repository! 🎉

Here you'll find handy scripts, code snippets, and small demo apps showcasing how to interact with the SecureFlag platform.

Whether you are exploring the API, testing out ideas, or looking for inspiration on how to integrate SecureFlag into your own organization, these examples are here to help you get up and running faster.

## Git hooks

Bring SecureFlag training and guidance to your local workflow with Git hooks!

Automatically enforce SecureFlag's vulnerability training compliance whenever a commit references a GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA).

📖 Read the Git hooks [`README.md`](/githooks/README.md) for setup instructions and details.

## Users' assignment report

Leverage the power of the SecureFlag APIs with a Python script that retrieves all users in your organization, along with their assigned learning paths and exercises.

This script demonstrates how to collect user details, fetch assignments and activities for each user, and export the combined results to a CSV report; giving you practical examples of API integration.

💻 Read the [`documentation`](/users_assignments_report/) to download and customize the script to create the reports you need!

## Users' assignment removal

Easily remove SecureFlag assignments with a Python script that validates activities, resolves UUIDs, and removes user assignments through the APIs. 
The script fetches fresh catalogs, checks input for errors, and provides clear per-user summaries on completion.

⚠️ Solved activities cannot be removed, and unassigned activities must be reassigned manually or via the APIs.

💻 Read the [`documentation`](/remove_assigned_activities/) to download and customize the script to remove assigned activities!
